TaskFlow Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Goals and Background Context
Goals
Launch a functional, high-quality demo application to validate the core product concept and gather initial user feedback.

Enable users to intuitively create, manage, and execute interactive checklists to standardize their repeatable processes.

Achieve initial user sign-ups to build a community and a base for future product development decisions.

Deliver an experience that feels like a modern, robust micro-SaaS application, even in its initial demo form.

Background Context
Many individuals and small teams struggle with process standardization. Existing tools are often either too basic (e.g., simple text checklists) or too cumbersome and expensive (e.g., full-scale project management software). TaskFlow aims to fill this gap by providing a streamlined and intuitive platform for creating and running interactive, templated checklists, saving users time and improving accuracy on their routine tasks. The application will be built on a modern, serverless Next.js stack to ensure a responsive user experience and scalable architecture.

FR2: Dashboard: Upon login, a dashboard must display all of the user's created checklist templates and their active, in-progress checklist instances.

FR3: Template Management: Users must be able to create, view, edit, and delete their own checklist templates.

FR4: Checklist Instantiation: Users must be able to start or "play" a new checklist instance from an existing template.

FR5: Interactive Player: The system must provide an interactive view for a running checklist instance where users can mark steps as complete and have their progress saved.

Non-Functional

NFR1: Technology Stack: The application must be built using Next.js 14+ (App Router), React, and TypeScript.


NFR2: Styling: The UI must be styled with Tailwind CSS and use Shadcn UI components.

NFR3: Database: The system must use a Vercel Postgres database, with interactions handled by Drizzle ORM.


NFR4: Deployment: The entire application must be deployable to the Vercel platform.

NFR5: Responsiveness: The user interface must be responsive and usable on modern desktop and mobile web browsers.

3. User Interface Design Goals
Overall UX Vision
The UX vision for TaskFlow is centered on clarity, speed, and intuitive design. The application should feel lightweight and responsive, empowering users to create and manage their processes with minimal friction. The interface will be clean and uncluttered, prioritizing the user's content and tasks over decorative elements.

Key Interaction Paradigms
Dashboard-Centric Model: The dashboard will be the user's primary hub for all activities.

Contextual Editing: A modal-based or slide-over panel will be used for template editing, allowing users to make changes without losing the context of their dashboard.

Real-time Feedback: Actions like saving, creating, or completing a step will provide immediate visual confirmation.

Core Screens and Views
From a product perspective, the following conceptual screens are necessary to deliver the core value:

Login / Sign-up Screen

Main Dashboard (listing templates and active checklists)

Template Builder / Editor View

Checklist "Player" / Runner View

Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA
The application will be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance, ensuring it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

Branding
Branding is to be determined. The initial aesthetic should be clean, professional, and minimalist, utilizing the Shadcn UI component style as a foundation.

Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application will be a responsive web app, optimized for a seamless experience on both modern desktop and mobile browsers.

4. Technical Assumptions
Repository Structure: Monorepo
A single repository will be used to house both the frontend and backend code. This approach simplifies dependency management and ensures consistency across the full-stack application.

Service Architecture
The application will be built using a serverless architecture, with backend logic handled by Next.js API Routes deployed as serverless functions on Vercel. This aligns with the "Next.js only" approach for a lean, scalable system.

Testing Requirements
The project will require Unit and Integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability. End-to-end tests will be considered for post-MVP development.

Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

Full-Stack Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router) 


Language: TypeScript throughout the stack. 


User Interface: React with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI for pre-built components. 

Database: Vercel Postgres.

Database Interaction: Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries.

Authentication: NextAuth.js.


Deployment: Vercel Platform. 

Payments (Post-MVP): Stripe Checkout.

5. Epic List
Epic 1: Foundational Setup & User Onboarding: Establish the core application infrastructure, secure user authentication, and provide a central dashboard for logged-in users.

Epic 2: Core Checklist Functionality: Enable users to create, manage, and run interactive checklists, delivering the primary value of the TaskFlow application.

6. Epic 1: Foundational Setup & User Onboarding
Goal: The goal of this epic is to build the essential scaffolding for the TaskFlow application. This includes setting up the project, establishing secure user authentication, and creating the main dashboard. By the end of this epic, a user will be able to sign up, log in, and see an empty but functional dashboard, providing a solid, testable foundation for all future features.

Story 1.1: Project Initialization
As a Developer, I want a new Next.js 14 project initialized with the chosen tech stack, so that I have a clean, consistent foundation to start building on.

Acceptance Criteria
A new Next.js 14 project using the App Router is created.

TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI are installed and configured.

Drizzle ORM and NextAuth.js are installed as dependencies.

A successful connection to the Vercel Postgres database is established.

The project can be run locally without errors.

A Git repository is initialized with a main branch and a proper .gitignore file.

Story 1.2: User Authentication
As a new User, I want to be able to sign up for an account and log in, so that I can access the application securely.

Acceptance Criteria
A user can create a new account using an email and password.

A new user record is successfully created in the database upon sign-up.

A user can log in with their correct credentials.

A user is shown an error message if they try to log in with incorrect credentials.

User sessions are managed securely, and a user can log out.

Story 1.3: Basic Dashboard
As a logged-in User, I want to see a main dashboard page, so that I have a central place to manage my work.

Acceptance Criteria
After a successful login, the user is redirected to a /dashboard route.

The dashboard page is a protected route, accessible only to authenticated users.

The page displays a welcome message.

The page includes a clear heading for "Checklist Templates" and "Active Checklists".

A button or link for "Create New Template" is visible.

A logout button is present and functional.

7. Epic 2: Core Checklist Functionality
Goal: The goal of this epic is to deliver the primary value of TaskFlow. Building on the foundation from Epic 1, these stories will allow a logged-in user to create their own checklist templates, manage them from the dashboard, and run them as interactive checklist instances. By the end of this epic, the core product loop will be complete and demonstrable.

Story 2.1: Create & Edit a Checklist Template
As a logged-in User, I want to create and edit a checklist template with a title and ordered steps, so that I can define a reusable process.

Acceptance Criteria
From the dashboard, clicking the "Create New Template" button opens a template builder view.

The user can enter a title for the template.

The user can add, edit, and delete text-based steps for the checklist.

The user can reorder the steps.

Saving the template creates a new record in the database linked to the user.

After saving, the user is returned to the dashboard where the new template is now visible.

An existing template can be opened in the same builder view to be edited and saved.

Story 2.2: Manage Templates on Dashboard
As a logged-in User, I want to see and manage all my created templates on the dashboard, so that I can easily access my processes.

Acceptance Criteria
The dashboard's "Checklist Templates" section correctly lists all templates created by the logged-in user.

Each list item displays the template's title.

Each list item has options (e.g., buttons or a menu) to "Start Checklist", "Edit", and "Delete" the template.

The "Edit" option opens the template in the builder view (as per Story 2.1).

The "Delete" option prompts for confirmation before permanently removing the template and its record from the database.

Story 2.3: Run an Interactive Checklist
As a logged-in User, I want to start an interactive session from a template and mark steps as complete, so that I can accurately follow my defined process.

Acceptance Criteria
Clicking "Start Checklist" on a template creates a new "checklist instance" record in the database, linked to the template and user.

The user is taken to an interactive "player" view for that instance.

The player view displays the list of steps from the template, each with a checkbox or similar control.

Checking a step marks it as complete, and the state is immediately saved to the database.

A user's progress is preserved if they leave and return to an in-progress checklist.

The dashboard's "Active Checklists" section now lists the newly started, in-progress checklist instance.

8. Checklist Results Report
This section will be populated with the results of a full validation against the Product Manager checklist. This formal check is typically performed by the Product Owner (PO) agent as a final quality gate to ensure all requirements are consistent, complete, and ready for development. The status is currently Pending.

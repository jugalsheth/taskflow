## Technical Notes

### Database Schema Requirements
- Create `team_invitations` table with:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `team_id` (UUID, foreign key to teams table)
  - `invited_email` (VARCHAR(255), required)
  - `invited_by` (UUID, foreign key to users table)
  - `token` (VARCHAR(255), unique, required)
  - `status` (VARCHAR(50), enum: 'pending', 'accepted', 'declined', 'expired')
  - `expires_at` (TIMESTAMP, required)
  - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
  - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

### API Endpoints Needed
- `GET /api/teams/[id]` - Get team details with members
- `POST /api/teams/[id]/invite` - Send team invitation
- `GET /api/teams/[id]/members` - Get team members list
- `PUT /api/teams/[id]/members/[userId]` - Update member role
- `DELETE /api/teams/[id]/members/[userId]` - Remove team member
- `GET /api/invitations/[token]` - Get invitation details
- `POST /api/invitations/[token]/accept` - Accept invitation
- `POST /api/invitations/[token]/decline` - Decline invitation

### UI Components Required
- Team Detail Page (`/teams/[id]`)
- Team Management Modal/Interface
- Invitation Form Component
- Member List Component
- Invitation Status Indicators
- Team Settings Form

### Business Logic
- Team ownership validation (only owners can manage roles)
- Admin permissions (admins can invite and remove members)
- Invitation token generation and validation
- Email service integration for notifications
- Role-based access control for team management

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.1.1 completion:
- Teams and team_members tables already exist
- Basic team creation and dashboard integration is functional
- Placeholder "View Team" and "Manage Team" buttons are in place
- Authentication and authorization patterns established
- Database schema patterns with Drizzle ORM are established

### Data Models
Building on existing architecture:
```typescript
interface TeamInvitation {
  id: string;
  teamId: string;
  invitedEmail: string;
  invitedBy: string;
  token: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'declined' | 'expired';
  expiresAt: Date;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface TeamWithMembers extends Team {
  members: TeamMember[];
  invitationCount: number;
  templateCount: number;
}
```

### API Specifications
Following existing patterns from Epic 2:
- Consistent JSON response format
- Authentication required for all endpoints
- Proper error handling and validation
- RESTful design principles
- Role-based authorization checks

### Component Specifications
Building on existing UI patterns:
- Use consistent styling with existing components
- Follow existing form patterns from team creation
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Responsive design for mobile compatibility
- Modal-based management interface

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- Team detail page: `src/app/teams/[id]/page.tsx`
- Team management modal: `src/components/teams/TeamManagementModal.tsx`
- Invitation form: `src/components/teams/InvitationForm.tsx`
- Member list: `src/components/teams/MemberList.tsx`
- Team API routes: `src/app/api/teams/[id]/route.ts`
- Invitation API routes: `src/app/api/invitations/[token]/route.ts`
- Database schema updates: `src/lib/schema.ts`

### Testing Requirements
Following established testing patterns:
- Unit tests for invitation logic and token validation
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for invitation flow
- Authorization tests for role-based access
- Email service integration tests

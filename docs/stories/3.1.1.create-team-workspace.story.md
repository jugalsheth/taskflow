# Story 3.1.1: Create Team Workspace

**Status:** READY FOR REVIEW
**Epic:** Epic 3.1: Team Workspaces & User Management  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 5  

## Story

**As a logged-in User**, I want to create a new team workspace, so that I can organize collaborative work with my colleagues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] User can create a new team from the dashboard via a "Create Team" button
- [x] Team creation form includes: name (required), description (optional), and privacy settings
- [x] Form validation ensures team name is unique within user's teams
- [x] Team creator automatically becomes the team owner with full permissions
- [x] New team appears in user's "My Teams" section on dashboard
- [x] Team creation shows success message and redirects to team dashboard
- [x] Team creation is logged for audit purposes

## Technical Notes

### Database Schema Requirements
- Create `teams` table with:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `name` (VARCHAR(255), required, unique per owner)
  - `description` (TEXT, optional)
  - `owner_id` (UUID, foreign key to users table)
  - `privacy_level` (VARCHAR(50), enum: 'private', 'public')
  - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
  - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

- Create `team_members` table with:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `team_id` (UUID, foreign key to teams table)
  - `user_id` (UUID, foreign key to users table)
  - `role` (VARCHAR(50), enum: 'owner', 'admin', 'member', 'viewer')
  - `joined_at` (TIMESTAMP)
  - Unique constraint on (team_id, user_id)

### API Endpoints Needed
- `POST /api/teams` - Create new team
- `GET /api/teams` - Get user's teams (for dashboard display)
- `GET /api/teams/[id]` - Get specific team details

### UI Components Required
- Team Creation Form (`/teams/new`)
- Team Creation Button (dashboard)
- My Teams Section (dashboard)
- Team Dashboard Layout (foundation for future stories)

### Business Logic
- Team ownership validation (users can only create teams for themselves)
- Team name uniqueness validation (per user)
- Automatic team member creation for team owner
- Role assignment (creator becomes owner)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Epic 2 completion:
- Authentication system is fully functional
- Dashboard structure exists and can be extended
- Template system provides foundation for team collaboration
- Database schema patterns established with Drizzle ORM

### Data Models
Based on existing architecture:
```typescript
interface Team {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  ownerId: string;
  privacyLevel: 'private' | 'public';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface TeamMember {
  id: string;
  teamId: string;
  userId: string;
  role: 'owner' | 'admin' | 'member' | 'viewer';
  joinedAt: Date;
}
```

### API Specifications
Following existing patterns from Epic 2:
- Consistent JSON response format
- Authentication required for all endpoints
- Proper error handling and validation
- RESTful design principles

### Component Specifications
Building on existing UI patterns:
- Use Shadcn UI components for consistency
- Follow existing form patterns from template creation
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Responsive design for mobile compatibility

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- Team creation page: `src/app/teams/new/page.tsx`
- Team API routes: `src/app/api/teams/route.ts`
- Team components: `src/components/teams/`
- Database schema updates: `src/lib/schema.ts`

### Testing Requirements
Following established testing patterns:
- Unit tests for team creation logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for team creation flow
- Validation tests for required fields
- Authorization tests (users can only create teams for themselves)

# Story 1.1: Project Initialization

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a new Next.js 14 project initialized with the chosen tech stack,
**so that** I have a clean, consistent foundation to start building on.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI are installed and configured.
3. Drizzle ORM and NextAuth.js are installed as dependencies.
4. A successful connection to the Vercel Postgres database is established.
5. The project can be run locally without errors.
6. A Git repository is initialized with a main branch and a proper .gitignore file.

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing requirements for this story - this is project setup only. Testing frameworks (Jest & RTL 30.0.5, Playwright 1.54.1) will be configured in future stories.

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Next.js 15.4.1 with App Router
- TypeScript 5.9
- Tailwind CSS 4.1.11
- Shadcn UI (latest)
- Drizzle ORM 0.44.3
- NextAuth.js 5.0.0-beta
- Vercel Postgres (latest)

**Development Workflow** [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]:
- Prerequisites: Node.js (v20.x+), pnpm
- Commands: `pnpm install` to set up, `pnpm dev` to run
- Environment variables: POSTGRES_URL and AUTH_SECRET required in .env.local

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Type sharing: Define shared types in shared package
- Environment variables: Access through centralized configuration object
- Data access: All database operations in services layer
- API responses: Consistent JSON format

### Project Structure Notes
The architecture specifies a monorepo structure with apps/web for the main application and packages for shared code. This story should establish the basic Next.js structure that can be expanded to match the full monorepo layout in future stories.

## Testing
No testing required for this story - this is project setup only.

Project Brief: TaskFlow
Executive Summary
TaskFlow is a micro-SaaS application designed to help individuals and small teams create, manage, and share interactive checklists and guided workflows. It targets users who find existing solutions either too simple for their needs or overly complex for standardizing repeatable processes. The core value is to provide an intuitive, efficient platform that saves time and improves accuracy.

Problem Statement
Many individuals and small teams struggle with standardizing processes. Ad-hoc checklists in note-taking apps lack structure and interactivity, while full-blown project management tools are often too cumbersome and expensive for simple process management. This leads to inconsistency, errors, and time wasted on recreating routine task lists. TaskFlow aims to fill this gap with a focused, streamlined solution.

Proposed Solution
TaskFlow will be a web-based SaaS application that allows users to build reusable, templated checklists. Users can then launch "instances" of these templates to guide them through a process, tracking their progress along the way. The solution will be built on a modern, serverless architecture using Next.js, allowing for a highly interactive user experience without the need for heavy backend infrastructure.

Target Users
The primary target users are individuals and small teams who need to perform repeatable, multi-step tasks with a high degree of accuracy. Examples include digital marketing agencies, content creators, small development teams, and operations managers.

Goals & Success Metrics
The primary goal of the initial version is to release a functional demo to gather user feedback and validate the core concept.

Business Objectives:

Successfully launch a live, public-facing demo application.

Gain initial user sign-ups to build a base for future feedback.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

User Sign-ups: Number of new user accounts created.

User Engagement: Number of checklist templates created and checklist instances run per user.

Core Task Completion Rate: Percentage of users who successfully create a template and run a checklist.

MVP Scope
Core Features (Must Have):

User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login for users to manage their private checklists.

Dashboard: A central hub where users can view their checklist templates and active checklist instances.

Template Builder: An intuitive editor to create, edit, and save checklist templates with ordered steps.

Interactive Checklist "Player": A clean interface to run through an active checklist, mark steps as complete, and track progress.

Checklist Management: Basic capabilities to view, edit, and delete created templates and instances.

Out of Scope for MVP:

Payment processing and user subscriptions.

Advanced team collaboration and sharing.

Analytics and reporting features.

Post-MVP Vision
Following a successful MVP launch, the vision is to expand TaskFlow with premium features, including:

Template Sharing: Allow users to share their custom templates with other users or publicly.

Team Collaboration: Introduce features for teams to work on checklists together.

Analytics & Reporting: Provide insights into process completion times and common failure points.

Monetization: Integrate Stripe to introduce subscription plans for Pro features.

Technical Considerations
Full-Stack Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)

User Interface (UI): React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI

Language: TypeScript

Database: Serverless PostgreSQL

Database Interaction: Drizzle ORM

Authentication: NextAuth.js

Deployment: Vercel

Constraints & Assumptions
Constraint: The initial version will be a non-commercial demo to validate the idea.

Assumption: The defined serverless architecture will be sufficient to handle the initial user load and feature set.

Risks & Open Questions
Risk: The core "interactive checklist player" may have unforeseen complexities, impacting the development timeline.

Open Question: What are the most critical steps or features users would be willing to pay for in a "Pro" version?

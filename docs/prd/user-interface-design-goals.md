# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The UX vision for TaskFlow is centered on clarity, speed, and intuitive design. The application should feel lightweight and responsive, empowering users to create and manage their processes with minimal friction. The interface will be clean and uncluttered, prioritizing the user's content and tasks over decorative elements.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**Dashboard-Centric Model**: The dashboard will be the user's primary hub for all activities.

**Contextual Editing**: A modal-based or slide-over panel will be used for template editing, allowing users to make changes without losing the context of their dashboard.

**Real-time Feedback**: Actions like saving, creating, or completing a step will provide immediate visual confirmation.

## Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the following conceptual screens are necessary to deliver the core value:

- Login / Sign-up Screen
- Main Dashboard (listing templates and active checklists)
- Template Builder / Editor View
- Checklist "Player" / Runner View

## Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA

The application will be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance, ensuring it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

## Branding

Branding is to be determined. The initial aesthetic should be clean, professional, and minimalist, utilizing the Shadcn UI component style as a foundation.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The application will be a responsive web app, optimized for a seamless experience on both modern desktop and mobile browsers.

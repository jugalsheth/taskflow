# Next Steps

This PRD now serves as the primary input for the UX Expert and the Architect.

## UX Expert Prompt

"Please review this PRD for TaskFlow, specifically the 'User Interface Design Goals' and all epics/stories. Your task is to create the detailed front-end-spec.md that will guide the UI implementation."

## Architect Prompt

"Please review this PRD for TaskFlow, paying close attention to the 'Technical Assumptions' and all epics/stories. Your task is to create the fullstack-architecture.md document that will serve as the technical blueprint for development."

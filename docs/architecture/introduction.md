# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for TaskFlow, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD, specific technologies have been chosen (Next.js, Drizzle, etc.), but no particular starter template (like the T3 Stack or a specific Vercel template) was specified. The architecture will therefore be based on a standard create-next-app initialization, with the required libraries and configurations added manually according to the patterns defined in this document.

# High Level Architecture

## Technical Summary

The architecture for TaskFlow is a modern, full-stack, serverless application deployed entirely on the Vercel platform. The frontend is a responsive React application built with Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. The backend consists of serverless functions, also handled by Next.js API Routes. Data is persisted in a Vercel Postgres database and accessed via the Drizzle ORM. This monorepo approach is designed for rapid development, type safety, scalability, and simplified operational overhead.

## High Level Overview

**Architectural Style**: A serverless architecture where the frontend and backend API are served by the same Next.js application.

**Repository Structure**: A Monorepo will be used to contain all frontend, backend, and shared code in a single repository, simplifying dependency management.

**Data Flow**: The user interacts with the React frontend, which makes API calls to the Next.js API routes. These serverless functions contain the business logic, interact with the database via Drizzle ORM, and return data to the frontend.

## Architectural and Design Patterns

**Serverless Architecture**: Using Next.js API Routes on Vercel for all backend logic eliminates the need to manage traditional servers, aligning with the goals of scalability and simplified deployment.

**Component-Based UI**: Utilizing React and Shadcn UI to build the frontend from modular, reusable components, promoting maintainability and development speed.

**ORM Pattern**: Using Drizzle ORM to abstract all database interactions. This provides critical type safety between the database and application code, reducing runtime errors.

**Monorepo**: Housing all code in a single repository. This is a best practice for full-stack TypeScript projects as it allows for easy sharing of types and utilities between the frontend and backend.

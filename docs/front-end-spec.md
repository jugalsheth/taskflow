# TaskFlow UI/UX Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for TaskFlow's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas
* **The Individual Professional:** A freelancer, consultant, or solo entrepreneur who needs to standardize their personal and client-facing processes to ensure consistency and quality. They value speed and simplicity.
* **The Small Team Lead:** A manager or senior team member responsible for operations. They need to create and share processes with their team to reduce errors and streamline onboarding. They value clarity and reliability.

#### Usability Goals
* **Ease of Learning:** A new user should be able to sign up, create their first template, and run a checklist in under 5 minutes.
* **Efficiency:** Frequent users should be able to manage their templates and checklists with minimal clicks and cognitive load.
* **Clarity:** The interface must be clean and intuitive, ensuring users always know what to do next without needing extensive documentation.

#### Design Principles
1.  **Clarity First:** Prioritize clear, unambiguous communication over clever or overly stylized design.
2.  **Frictionless Workflow:** Every interaction should be designed to move the user toward their goal as efficiently as possible.
3.  **Consistency is Key:** Use consistent patterns and components throughout the application to create a predictable and trustworthy experience.

## 2. Information Architecture (IA)

### Site Map / Screen Inventory

Navigation Structure
Primary Navigation: Once logged in, the primary navigation will be a persistent header bar containing:

A logo/link that returns the user to their Dashboard.

A user menu with links to Account Settings and a Logout option.

Breadcrumbs: Given the simple, dashboard-centric model of the MVP, breadcrumbs are not necessary. This can be reconsidered if the application's complexity grows in the future.

3. User Flows
User Onboarding (Sign-up & Login)
User Goal: To securely create an account and log in to access their dashboard.
Entry Points: Visiting the application's homepage for the first time.
Success Criteria: User successfully lands on their personal dashboard after signing up or logging in.

    K -- Yes --> G;

    E -- No --> L[Show Sign-up Error];
    L --> C;
    K -- No --> M[Show Login Error];
    M --> I;
Edge Cases & Error Handling:
User attempts to sign up with an email that already exists.

User enters an invalid password during login.

User's session expires, requiring them to log in again.

Creating a New Checklist Template
User Goal: To define a new, reusable checklist process with a title and a series of ordered steps.
Entry Points: Clicking the "Create New Template" button on the main dashboard.
Success Criteria: The user's new template is saved and appears in the "Checklist Templates" list on their dashboard.

    subgraph J
        K[New Template is Visible]
    end

    G -- No --> L[Show Validation Error];
    L --> C;
Edge Cases & Error Handling:
User tries to save a template with no title.

User tries to save a template with no steps.

User attempts to close the builder with unsaved changes (should prompt for confirmation).

A network error occurs during the save operation.

Running an Interactive Checklist
User Goal: To start a new checklist from a template and track its completion step-by-step.
Entry Points: Clicking the "Start Checklist" button on a template from the main dashboard.
Success Criteria: The user can successfully mark steps as complete, have their progress saved, and see the active checklist instance on their dashboard.

    D --> H{User Navigates Away};
    H --> I([Back to Dashboard]);
    
    subgraph I
        J[Instance is Visible in 'Active Checklists']
    end

    J --> K{User Clicks Active Checklist};
    K --> D;
Edge Cases & Error Handling:
What happens when the final step is checked? (e.g., show a "Checklist Complete!" message).

A network error occurs while trying to save the progress of a step.

A user navigates directly to a URL for an active checklist that does not belong to them.

4. Wireframes & Mockups
The single source of truth for all high-fidelity mockups and visual designs will be maintained in a dedicated design file.

Primary Design Files: [Link to Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD Project TBD]

Key Screen Layouts
Dashboard
Purpose: To serve as the user's main hub, providing an at-a-glance view of their templates and active checklists, and offering clear entry points to core tasks.

Key Elements:

Header: Contains the app logo and a user menu (for Account Settings/Logout).

Primary Action: A prominent "Create New Template" button.

Template Section: A list or grid of the user's "Checklist Templates," each with options to Start, Edit, or Delete.

Active Section: A list or grid of the user's "Active Checklists" that are currently in progress.

Design File Reference: [Link to the specific Dashboard frame in the design file]

5. Component Library / Design System
Design System Approach: We will use the pre-built, accessible components from Shadcn UI as our foundational design system. We will customize these components as needed to match our specific branding, rather than creating a new component library from scratch.

Core Components
Button
Purpose: To trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form or opening a modal.

Variants: We will use the standard Shadcn UI variants: default (for primary actions, e.g., "Save"), secondary (for less prominent actions), destructive (for actions that delete data), and ghost or link (for tertiary actions).

States: All button variants must have clear visual states for default, hover, focus, and disabled.

Usage Guidelines: Limit one default (primary) button per view to clearly guide the user toward the main action.

6. Branding & Style Guide
Brand Guidelines: [Link to formal brand guidelines to be determined]

Color Palette
Color Type	Hex Code	Usage
Primary	#2563EB (Blue)	Buttons, links, active states, key actions
Accent	#10B981 (Green)	Success messages, confirmation, positive indicators
Warning	#FBBF24 (Amber)	Non-critical alerts, important notices
Error	#EF4444 (Red)	Error messages, destructive action confirmation
Neutral	#FFFFFF to #020617	Backgrounds, text, borders, and UI surfaces

Export to Sheets
Typography
Primary Font: Inter (A clean, highly readable sans-serif font, perfect for UI)

Monospace Font: Roboto Mono (For any code snippets or technical text)

Element	Size	Weight	Line Height
H1	2.25rem	700 (Bold)	2.5rem
H2	1.875rem	700 (Bold)	2.25rem
H3	1.5rem	700 (Bold)	2rem
Body	1rem	400 (Regular)	1.5rem
Small	0.875rem	400 (Regular)	1.25rem

Export to Sheets
Iconography
Icon Library: We will use Lucide Icons, which is modern, comprehensive, and integrates seamlessly with Shadcn UI.

Spacing & Layout
Grid System: We will use a standard 4px/8px grid system, managed via Tailwind CSS's default spacing scale, to ensure consistent margins and padding throughout the application.

7. Accessibility Requirements
Compliance Target
The application will be designed and developed to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standard.

Key Requirements
Visual:

All text must meet a minimum color contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against its background.

All interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields) must have a clear and visible focus indicator.

The UI must support text resizing up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.

Interaction:

All functionality must be operable via a keyboard, without requiring a mouse.

The application will be tested for compatibility with modern screen readers (e.g., JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver).

Touch targets on mobile views will be sufficiently large to be easily tappable.

Content:

All meaningful images will have descriptive alternative text (alt text).

Pages will use a logical and semantic heading structure (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) to facilitate navigation.

All form inputs will have clear, programmatically associated labels.

Testing Strategy
Accessibility will be validated through a combination of automated scanning tools (like Axe), manual keyboard and screen reader testing, and regular design reviews.

8. Responsiveness Strategy
Breakpoints
Breakpoint	Min Width	Target Devices
Mobile	0px	Most smartphones
Tablet	768px	iPads, large tablets
Desktop	1024px	Laptops, standard monitors
Wide	1280px	Large desktop monitors

Export to Sheets
Adaptation Patterns
Layout Changes: On mobile, the layout will be a single, stacked column to prioritize content. On tablet and desktop, the layout will expand to a wider, centered view, potentially using multiple columns on the dashboard.

Navigation Changes: On mobile, primary navigation options may be collapsed into a "hamburger" menu to save space. On desktop, they will be visible in the header.

Content Priority: Critical content and primary actions will always be positioned for easy access on all screen sizes.

Interaction Changes: Touch targets for buttons and links will be sufficiently large on mobile to ensure ease of use.

9. Animation & Micro-interactions
Motion Principles
Purposeful: All motion should serve a purpose, such as providing feedback, guiding attention, or indicating a state change.

Subtle & Quick: Animations should be swift (generally 200-300ms) and unobtrusive, enhancing the experience without slowing the user down.

Accessible: All animations must respect the prefers-reduced-motion setting in a user's browser or operating system.

Key Animations
State Changes: Interactive elements like buttons and input fields will have subtle transitions for hover, focus, and pressed states.

Modal & Panel Transitions: Modals and slide-over panels (like the Template Builder) will smoothly fade or slide into view to provide better contextual awareness.

Loading States: When data is being fetched, we will use subtle animations like spinners or shimmering placeholder "skeleton" loaders.

List Updates: When a new item is added to a list (like a new template), it will subtly fade in to draw the user's attention to the change.

10. Performance Considerations
Performance Goals
Page Load: The application should strive to achieve a Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) of under 2.5 seconds on a standard connection.

Interaction Response: Key user interactions, like clicking a button or checking a box, should provide feedback in under 200 milliseconds, aiming for a good Interaction to Next Paint (INP) score.

Animation FPS: All animations and transitions should maintain a consistent 60 frames per second (FPS) to feel smooth and fluid.

Design Strategies
To achieve these goals, the following strategies will be employed:

Leveraging Next.js for server-side rendering to ensure fast initial page loads.

Optimizing all images to reduce file size.

Code-splitting by route to only load the JavaScript necessary for the current view.

Using "skeleton" loaders to improve the perceived performance while data is being fetched.

11. Next Steps
Immediate Actions
Stakeholder Review: This completed UI/UX Specification should be shared with any other project stakeholders for final approval.

Visual Design Generation: Use the AI UI Generation Prompt we created to generate the initial visual designs and components in a tool like Vercel's v0. Save the resulting code.

Architect Handoff: Provide this document and the PRD to the Architect to begin creating the detailed front-end-architecture.md, which will define the final project structure.
